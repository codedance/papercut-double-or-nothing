# PaperCut Double or Nothing! #

This is my example script for the EduGeek [PaperCut](http://www.papercut.com/) 
print script competition.

See http://www.papercut.com/edugeek/competition/

Also check out the [Demo Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=HJ2XkhxoDSU).

Its objective is simple:

>
>   "Make money for the school's IT Department's end-of-year party!"
>

This objective is achieved by running a 100% illegal and clandestine gambling 
racket among students.  It allows the students to wager their print credit in 
a simple game of "double or nothing" - they either win a free print job or 
pay double. While this is happening "the house" (aka the IT Department) 
siphon off 10% into a secret hidden account.

The script uses all the "tricks" for the gambling industry including:

* Suck students in using a fancy "animated GIF" popup Ad (you find them 
  all over the internet... they must be effective!)

* Tempt students to play again by highlighting the number of times they 
  have won (but never talk about how much they have lost).

* Open the game only to an exclusive group such as "Senior Students".  
  This minimised that chance of the Principle/Dean finding out.

* Remind students that it's 100% illegal. Students will do anything if 
  it's illegal!

* Every time someone in the IT Department prints, a secret message will 
  display in the task tray letting us know how much illegal money we've 
  made.

This script is a parody. I suggest only running it on the 1st of April, or if
you have a spare few years for the jail time :-)
