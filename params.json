{"name":"Papercut-double-or-nothing","tagline":"An example entry for the PaperCut EduGeek print script competition.","body":"# PaperCut Double or Nothing! #\r\n\r\nThis is my example script for the EduGeek [PaperCut](http://www.papercut.com/) \r\nprint script competition.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.papercut.com/edugeek/competition/\r\n\r\nAlso check out the [Demo Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=HJ2XkhxoDSU).\r\n\r\nIts objective is simple:\r\n\r\n>\r\n>   \"Make money for the school's IT Department's end-of-year party!\"\r\n>\r\n\r\nThis objective is achieved by running a 100% illegal and clandestine gambling \r\nracket among students.  It allows the students to wager their print credit in \r\na simple game of \"double or nothing\" - they either win a free print job or \r\npay double. While this is happening \"the house\" (aka the IT Department) \r\nsiphon off 10% into a secret hidden account.\r\n\r\nThe script uses all the \"tricks\" for the gambling industry including:\r\n\r\n* Suck students in using a fancy \"animated GIF\" popup Ad (you find them \r\n  all over the internet... they must be effective!)\r\n\r\n* Tempt students to play again by highlighting the number of times they \r\n  have won (but never talk about how much they have lost).\r\n\r\n* Open the game only to an exclusive group such as \"Senior Students\".  \r\n  This minimised that chance of the Principle/Dean finding out.\r\n\r\n* Remind students that it's 100% illegal. Students will do anything if \r\n  it's illegal!\r\n\r\n* Every time someone in the IT Department prints, a secret message will \r\n  display in the task tray letting us know how much illegal money we've \r\n  made.\r\n\r\n## Screen Shots\r\n\r\n*Tempt the student!*\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/codedance/papercut-double-or-nothing/master/images/screen-shot-1.png\" />\r\n\r\n*You're a winner!*\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/codedance/papercut-double-or-nothing/master/images/screen-shot-2.png\" />\r\n\r\n*You lost (but we've got some funds for our party :-)*\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/codedance/papercut-double-or-nothing/master/images/screen-shot-3.png\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install this script, perform the following:\r\n\r\n1.
